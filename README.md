# 🚀 About

BillBoard is a comprehensive platform designed to keep Canadians informed and engaged with their government. We provide Canadians real-time policy updates, a community forum for discussions, and a map to find representatives. We also have numerous features to help you learn and engage, such as our AI chatbot Billy!

We built BillBoard at [Hack the Change 2024](https://hackthechangeyyc.ca/).
